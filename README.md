Calculation of trajectories for a mass-spring dynamic system and plotting of its phase portraits.

# Description

This project utilizes the Matlab environment to simulate a mass-spring dynamic system and design its phase portraits. By displacing the system from its natural equilibrium position, we study its motion and the time required for it to return to rest. Modeling it as a second-order dynamic system enables us to design the phase portrait for various initial conditions and extract position and velocity diagrams as functions of time.
